        <p>College and university scholarships are a convenient way
          to pay for an undergraduate degree, but many students are confused about how the whole process works.
          How is the money awarded and what can you spend it on? What about outside scholarships?If youre wondering 
          how scholarships work, this is the guide for you. Below, we answer big questions ranging from 
          “What is a scholarship?”</p>


          <h3 className="my-5">What is a scholarship?</h3>
          <p>For colleges and universities, scholarships are financial aid awards designed to help students pay for 
          an undergraduate degree. Sometimes a scholarship is a one-time check. Other school scholarships are 
          renewable and provide money for students each semester or school year. These awards differ from student 
          loans in that they do not have to be repaid.</p>
          <p>Students might receive the money directly as a check in their name. In other cases, the money is given to 
          the students school. In these cases, the student would then pay the school for the difference on any money 
          owed for tuition, fees, room and board. If the scholarships and other forms of financial aid are enough to 
          cover the direct college costs, the excess money is refunded to the student.
